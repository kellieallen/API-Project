Used Edamam API to create Buzzfeed-like quiz

This assignment required me to request data from an API and display the results. I decided to do a twist on the traditional Buzzfeed quiz: enter your favorite food and two images will appear from the Edamam food API. Select your favorite picture and the result will tell you who is your soulmate from The Office. Those results are a JavaScript function that will randomly assign the user to one of four Office characters.
